## PHP

### Alternative interpreters and compilers

* [HippyVM](https://github.com/hippyvm/hippyvm) - an implementation of the PHP language using RPython/PyPy technology
* [KPHP](https://vkcom.github.io/kphp/) - compiles a limited subset of PHP to a native binary running faster than PHP
* [php.js](http://phpjs.hertzen.com/) -  reads PHP code and transforms it into JavaScript code and then runs
* [PH7](https://ph7.symisc.net/) - An Embedded Implementation of PHP, see its [distinctive features](https://ph7.symisc.net/features.html)
* [pipp](https://github.com/bschmalhofer/pipp) - an implementation of the language PHP that runs on Parrot
* [Quercus](https://www.caucho.com/resin-3.1/doc/quercus.xtp) - Java implementation of the PHP language

### Trans-compilers from other languages to PHP

* [Blueberry](https://github.com/gosukiwi/Blueberry) - a script language with clean syntax, inspired from Ruby, CoffeeScript, and Python which compiles to PHP
* [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) - high-level strictly-typed programming language with a fast optimizing cross-compiler which also compiles to PHP
* [Pharen](https://github.com/scriptor/pharen) - compiles a Lisp-inspired language to PHP
* [Phel](https://phel-lang.org/) - dialect of Lisp that compiles to PHP
* [Pratphall](http://cretz.github.io/pratphall/) - an optionally-typed language that compiles to readable PHP
* [Salty](https://github.com/egonschiele/salty) - a language that compiles to PHP, JavaScript, and JSX; Haskell-inspired
* [Snowscript](https://github.com/runekaagaard/snowscript) - a language that compiles to PHP; its syntax is inspired by Python, Lua, Coffescript, Go and Scala and strives to be DRY, clean and easy to read as well as write
* [THT](https://tht.dev/) - a clean re-design of PHP, making it more secure and easier to use

### Preprocessors

* [Pre](https://preprocess.io/) - compiles new syntax to work in new and old versions of PHP
