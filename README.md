# Alternative Interpreters

## PHP

### Alternative interpreters and compilers

* [HippyVM](https://github.com/hippyvm/hippyvm) - an implementation of the PHP language using RPython/PyPy technology
* [KPHP](https://vkcom.github.io/kphp/) - compiles a limited subset of PHP to a native binary running faster than PHP
* [php.js](http://phpjs.hertzen.com/) -  reads PHP code and transforms it into JavaScript code and then runs
* ❤️ [PH7](https://ph7.symisc.net/) - An Embedded Implementation of PHP 5 with a lot of PHP 7+ and C++-like improvements, see its [distinctive features](https://ph7.symisc.net/features.html)
* [PHPPHP](https://github.com/ircmaxell/PHPPHP) - PHP interpreter written in PHP, low performance - for much faster one see: Recki-CT
* [pipp](https://github.com/bschmalhofer/pipp) - an implementation of the language PHP that runs on Parrot
* [pyhp](https://github.com/juokaz/pyhp) - incomplete implementation of the PHP language using the RPython technology (for complete implementation see: HippyVM)
* [pyhp.js](https://github.com/juokaz/pyhp.js) - PyHP interpreter translated into JavaScript using emscripten, resulting javascript file is asm.js which can be loaded in any browser or ran with Node.js
* [Quercus](https://www.caucho.com/resin-3.1/doc/quercus.xtp) - Java implementation of the PHP language
* [Recki Compiler Toolkit for PHP](https://github.com/google/recki-ct) - a compiler for PHP written in PHP (outputs code that is faster than native PHP)

### Transpilers ###


### Trans-compilers from other languages to PHP

* [Blueberry](https://github.com/gosukiwi/Blueberry) - a script language with clean syntax, inspired from Ruby, CoffeeScript, and Python which compiles to PHP
* [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) - high-level strictly-typed programming language with a fast optimizing cross-compiler which also compiles to PHP
* [Phabel](https://github.com/phabelio/phabel) - allows native usage of PHP 8+ features and especially syntax in projects and libraries, while allowing maintainers to publish a version targeting lower versions of php
* [Pharen](https://github.com/scriptor/pharen) - compiles a Lisp-inspired language to PHP
* [Phel](https://phel-lang.org/) - dialect of Lisp that compiles to PHP
* [Pratphall](http://cretz.github.io/pratphall/) - an optionally-typed language that compiles to readable PHP
* [Salty](https://github.com/egonschiele/salty) - a language that compiles to PHP, JavaScript, and JSX; Haskell-inspired
* [Snowscript](https://github.com/runekaagaard/snowscript) - a language that compiles to PHP; its syntax is inspired by Python, Lua, Coffescript, Go and Scala and strives to be DRY, clean and easy to read as well as write
* [THT](https://tht.dev/) - a clean re-design of PHP, making it more secure and easier to use

### Preprocessors

* [Pre](https://preprocess.io/) - compiles new syntax to work in new and old versions of PHP

### Other

* [AerScript](https://github.com/sc0ttj/AerScript) - general-purpose, object-oriented scripting programming language based on PH7 (alternative PHP interpreter)
